zabanshenas (زبان‌شناس / zæbænʒenæs) which has two meanings
- A person who studies linguistics.
Or
- A way to identify the type of written language.

This is a preliminary step in creating a language detection script that inherits benefits from Transformer architecture. 

Nowadays, Transformers have played a huge role in Natural Language Processing fields. Simply, Transformers uses an attention mechanism to boost the speed and extract a high level of information (abstraction). 

There are plenty of ways, solutions, and packages to find the language of a written piece of text or document. All of them have their own pros and cons, some able to detect faster and support as many languages as possible. But in this case,  I plan to implement a scenario that is capable of understanding similar groups of languages as well as covering more than 200 languages (235 exactly) thanks to WiLI-2018 and the Transformer architecture.
